# DATA3888 Discipline 2 - Classifying Tumour Cells

Hello! This is one of the projects I worked on for a data science capstone individual assessment. I completed this in my 3rd year!

For this project, it was a "mock client pitch" to suggest to an immunologist different predictive models that would help to classify healthy immune cells from tumour cells, using H&E stained imaging.

Essentially, I have built and evaluated 3 models with a final model suggestion based on performance.

I go through the process in a way that is hopefully clear to someone who doesn't have a strong statistical background.
